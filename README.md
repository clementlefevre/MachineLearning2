# Matching her lines.
a partial fork of a very good guide "Building Machine Learning systems with Python" Willi Richert & Luis Pedro Coelho.

On top of that a brief implementation of linear regression of myself.

in the so_girl part, you'll find a draft of stack hottest girl, which consist in :

- scrap profile from SO users
- use openCV for face detection and eyes alignment.
- implement gender detection with Fisherface algo from Philipp Wagner facerec project
- then filter profil pic by gender and deploy a small polling app.

Use the conda distro if you wan't to avoid a world of pain.
