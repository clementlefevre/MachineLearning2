I must try not to become emotional in these exchanges, the subject is too important for such nonsense, though I do try to back up what I say with whatever evidence I can find. But ad hominem attacks are really dumb and almost always counter-productive, and I should avoid them just as everyone else should. The facts really do speak for themselves, and anyone who resorts to insults, which I sincerely hope I do very seldom, is quite properly described as an idiot in my view.</p><p>This is the most important issue of our time. I hope we can still sway sufficient numbers to seek diplomatic rather than armed responses. I am quite certain Russians feel precisely the same way. They are no more interested in world domination than you or I are. And just as terrified of another world war. The more we agitate for greater Nato armaments to be sent against Russia's perceived \"advantages\" on Europe's eastern borders, the more we indicate that Nato exists only because of a perceived Russian \"threat\", which really isn't there in my view.\u00a0</p><p>We need to keep making the point. Common sense alone should tell people that there is absolutely nothing whatsoever for Russia to gain from any military incursion in the Baltics. Putin's response to the Crimean plebiscite was not just \"acceptable\" to Russians, it was an imperative for 99% of the population. His domestic popularity would have been destroyed if he had failed to respond to the Crimean issue and, on the other hand, would be completely destroyed, at a stroke, if he revealed any imperialist intentions further west. This has to be so obvious to anyone who gives the matter a moments thought. We can't seem to get away from the Soviet era / cold war thinking, and yet Russians have.</p><p>Thanks again for the support.

To start:</p><p>1) There is no evidence that Russia is either \"launching missiles at hospitals\" (something that the US has done in numerous countries) or trying to aggravate the refugee crisis. Independent accounts at the Turkish border currently do not speak to the millions of refugees \u00a0that were escaping ISIS and the various \"moderate\" factions associated with Al Qaeda.</p><p>2) The \"moderate\" factions that this editorial cites as a lost opportunity were never numerous enough to be effective even from the start and now that moniker has the validity of Iraqi WMDs as they no longer exist anywhere outside of the minds of Beltway armchair generals. \u00a0</p><p>3) The reports of Assad's use of chemical weapons in this war has been discredited in all serious foreign affairs publications. Why this paper continues to do so is beyond reason.\u00a0</p><p>4) The effects of the sanctions (which are an act of war in actuality) is overhyped in the West. The Russian economy has been negatively affected mostly by low oil prices and both that and the sanctions have forced the Russian economy to diversify and refocus on non-European economies. Iran is a perfect example of a country that has survived more onerous sanctions campaigns and Russia will as well and come out a much stronger country in every respect. Increasing sanctions will just make Putin's domestic support soar further.</p><p>5) Putin as the boogieman who embodies all that is evil in the most comicbook way imaginable has gotten old and irrational. He has been reactionary at best both in Syria and the Ukraine. The Crimea was an autonomous oblast that was always uneasy about being part of an independent Ukraine and Putin only moved when it was clear that NATO had designs on Sevastopol under control of the Junta proxy government in Kiev. The referendum there was more consistent with international law than the process with the breakaway of Kosovo that this paper has never spoken against. The Russian Syrian campaign only began when the Russian UK ambassador was told that ISIS was going to take Aleppo in the next 6-8 weeks. Not the biggest fan of Putin but to associate him with Hitler and Stalin is just stupid.\u00a0</p><p>6) To quote a madman like McCain really is the icing on the cake. Obama is bad but one of the greatest American achievements of the past 25 years is avoiding a McCain presidency in '08.</p><p>What is clear from the rabidly anti-Russian/Chinese diatribes from this and most other Western papers is that the West is in decline and is viscerally terrified of that eventuality.\u00a0<br/></p>", "authorId": "3535844@ft.fyre.co", "id": "462087909", "authorName": "Christian Richard"}, {"comment": "<p><a vocab=\"http://schema.org\" typeof=\"Person\" rel=\"nofollow\" resource=\"acct:3535844@ft.fyre.co\" data-lf-handle=\"\" data-lf-provider=\"livefyre\" property=\"url\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"fyre-mention fyre-mention-livefyre\">@<span property=\"name\">Christian Richard</span></a> </p><p>Excellent summary, btw. \u00a0I have saved your comment for future reference.</p>", "authorId": "3882585@ft.fyre.co", "id": "462094026", "authorName": "Njegos"}, {"comment": "<p><a vocab=\"http://schema.org\" typeof=\"Person\" rel=\"nofollow\" resource=\"acct:3882585@ft.fyre.co\" data-lf-handle=\"\" data-lf-provider=\"livefyre\" property=\"url\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"fyre-mention fyre-mention-livefyre\">@<span property=\"name\">Njegos</span></a>\u00a0<a vocab=\"http://schema.org\" typeof=\"Person\" rel=\"nofollow\" resource=\"acct:3535844@ft.fyre.co\" data-lf-handle=\"\" data-lf-provider=\"livefyre\" property=\"url\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"fyre-mention fyre-mention-livefyre\">@<span property=\"name\">Christian Richard</span></a>\u00a0 I agree.

Dividing it by responsibilities was possibly not a bad solution.\u00a0 Lebanon was incredibly successful. Tribalism and Religious prejudice is rampant throughout Africa where societies used to be relatively stable. Perhaps a bigger cause of violence in the Middle East could be attributed to the mismanagement of the Balfour Declaration. That is where fundamentalism really became and remains ugly. One problem the US has not recovered from is its fundamental opposition to the British Empire, which had many faults, but did permit stable governance and perhaps glacially slow increase to full democracy. However India and Pakistan are not\u00a0 perhaps the best solution to the religious divisions in the old colonial India. The country would probably have developed more rapidly if religious tolerance had been learned, and the fundamentalist crisis\u00a0 of Pakistan might have been avoided. \u00a0 Currently observers say that the problems in Afghanistan and Iraq arise from the lack of a long term stabilising \"power\" that makes violence and extremism an unacceptable option. so that peaceful resolution of conflicts is followed.\u00a0 The US is not willing to spend the time and resources to do that.\u00a0 The UN is too poor and weak. In the 19th century the UK was doing just that. However in the US view that was not democratic and unjust.\u00a0 However there seems to be a naive view that democracy does not need time and security to develop, and the dictators of the world have been showing how easily it can be uprooted. Where has the US attempt at creating democracies succeeded?\u00a0 (It has done a great job of stabilising weak but long standing democracies.)\u00a0 Perhaps this can be attributed to the US\u00a0 violent and erratic\u00a0 political system, with the political need to demonstrate\u00a0 short term profit.<br/></p>", "authorId": "211023@ft.fyre.co", "id": "462075545", "authorName": "Mouldover"}, {"comment": "<p><a vocab=\"http://schema.org\" typeof=\"Person\" rel=\"nofollow\" resource=\"acct:211023@ft.fyre.co\" data-lf-handle=\"\" data-lf-provider=\"livefyre\" property=\"url\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"fyre-mention fyre-mention-livefyre\">@<span property=\"name\">Mouldover</span></a>\u00a0<a vocab=\"http://schema.org\" typeof=\"Person\" rel=\"nofollow\" resource=\"acct:7402558@ft.fyre.co\" data-lf-handle=\"\" data-lf-provider=\"livefyre\" property=\"url\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"fyre-mention fyre-mention-livefyre\">@<span property=\"name\">Thumbscrew</span></a>\u00a0<a vocab=\"http://schema.org\" typeof=\"Person\" rel=\"nofollow\" resource=\"acct:3882585@ft.fyre.co\" data-lf-handle=\"\" data-lf-provider=\"livefyre\" property=\"url\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"fyre-mention fyre-mention-livefyre\">@<span property=\"name\">Njegos</span></a> </p><p>There is much truth in what you say. The UK's price of victory in WW2 was the dismemberment of the Empire and acceptance for good or ill of US world hegemony so that coca cola could be sold everywhere. US imperialism was and remains commercial. For much of the post war period the US hegemony as the world's policeman was relatively benign with some very obvious hiccups Vietnam etc). It really did intend to do good in its own way. The release of its diplomatic documents tend to support this view rather than a malevolent intention (it would be interesting to have an equal leaking of equivalent Russian or Chinese documents...) The supremacy of Rumsfeld, Cheney et al in George W Bush's administration completely overthrew this consensual approach and its vindictiveness against the rump of the USSR, denying financial assistance when it was requested, has had a very pernicious effect not only in ME and elsewhere, but in Russia itself, which, humiliated, has led to the rise, popularity and desire of Putin to cut an international power figure on the world stage to assuage that humiliation. Short term Putin looks like the great chess player, out manouevrng his opponents at every step. But although an excellent tactician, he is no strategist. To be a world power you have to have heft for the long term. Louis XIV beggared his country in pursuit of hegemony, so did Napoleon. The list is lengthy. Sooner or later those foreign adventures that prop up popularity at home become self-destructive. Even if he succeeds in propping up the Assad regime in the very short term, it cannot last. Assad is anathema to his own people.

When studying at university I found that people with an IQ 2 - 3 standard deviations above the mean (those in the positive sciences mostly) tend to agree with people of average IQ on many practical issues of life, including social policy; i.e. what's perceived as \"COMMON SENSE\". People of average IQ intuitively feel common sense is right. People with very high IQ understand why common sense is right on many topics. The problem is with people 1 - 2 standard deviations above the mean (mostly those in social and human sciences, etc). They tend to be swayed by crackpot fashionable ideas (often left-wing) which obviously don't make sense to those much smarter than them and which intuitively seem wrong to people of average intelligence. I used to label people \u00a01 - 2 standard deviations above the mean the most dangerous people in the world. They are smart enough to reach positions of power and influence and they are numerous meaning they have an outsized influence on decision making all around. Furthermore, since they're comfortably above the mean they are confident and feel smart and are often not open to people with different ideas. Rather they believe it's their god given right to insult those who think differently (shoot the messenger as opposed to the content). This is a big flaw people of average intelligence don't have: they know it makes sense to take good advice from time to time (common sense once again). \u00a0</p>", "authorId": "3748808@ft.fyre.co", "id": "462058343", "authorName": "Pepin"}, {"comment": "<p><a vocab=\"http://schema.org\" typeof=\"Person\" rel=\"nofollow\" resource=\"acct:7473112@ft.fyre.co\" data-lf-handle=\"\" data-lf-provider=\"livefyre\" property=\"url\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"fyre-mention fyre-mention-livefyre\">@<span property=\"name\">Karl Marx</span></a> Europe has already begun to be destroyed by the refugees as we don't count the number of rapes in swimming-pool in Germany, the assaults on girls like in Finland, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and hidden by our media (making them known only after 15 days, unbelievable !), the terrorist attacks like in Paris but certainly 130 dead people is not enough for you, like 260 injured at the Boston marathon was already not enough...</p><p>You're a propagandist paid for speaking positively of this, worst than in China or Russia as you fabric the opinion for our sadness on our newspaper.

Europe has a population of about 40 million in the age bracket of 20 - 30 years old. Adding 3 - 4 million Muslim migrants (almost all in that same age bracket) to that amounts to 10% of the population. 10% in one single year! Factor in divergent birth rates and it will take surprisingly little time (less than 100 years) for Muslims to become a majority in Europe. Do the math and you'll see the amazing impact of exponential growth and its wide divergence over time at different growth rate factors. Western European countries such France and Belgium are already getting close to having a Muslim majority in the 0 - 5 y.o. age bracket. Meaning native Christian French are set to be a minority in their own country probably as soon as 2060 - 2070.

So she decided to do what is fashionable - Russia bashing. It is very unfortunate. One can't turn against his/her country/people even after emigration, don't have to defend it but turn against it either.</p><p>It is especially interesting to see people clueless on economics making economic forecasts. So here are a few facts (since the FT has long given up on reporting facts) that people should be aware of.\u00a0</p><p>I invested into Russian Eurobonds (Sberbank, VTB, Gazprom, VEB and others) in December 2014, when this newspaper and its \"guest demagogues\" such as Julia thought Russia was going to hell, or as Julia wrote in this article \"there will be no end to Russia's economic crisis\".\u00a0</p><p>Well, I bought these bonds at around US$ 0.65 cents to the dollar, now they all trade above US$ 0.9 to the dollar. So somehow global financial markets don't think Russia is going to hell. Note that these bonds have rallied in US$ denominated prices, in RUB terms they rallied even more. The Russian economy is stabilising, all indicators from confidence to retail sales point to this trend and lots of Russian people are busy launching domestic businesses - from cheese and milk production to furniture manufacturing - all locally. Don't confuse \"growth rates\" with \"levels\" as most journalists do.</p><p>Now in terms of what Russian people enjoy or not, what Putin's third term is about \"projecting power internationally\" and all this other concocted nonsense. Here is another fact about Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. If Americans allowed the Soviets to turn Afghanistan into a less fundamentalist, less religious and more civilised country there would have been no 9/11, no war in Iraq, no Libya, no bombings in Paris, no ISIS and no Syria. Millions and millions of lives would have been saved. But no, the SU lost in Afghanistan, then we got Al Qaeda (originally trained and financed by America to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan), then we got 9/11 and we know the rest.\u00a0</p><p>Lastly, about what part of Russians agree on what happened with Crimea. Sure, \"Russian Liberals\" <em>a la</em> Ksenia Sobchak are a special breed. As Ksenia wrote in her open letter last year, after Putin hit Europe with food import sanctions, \"why should I give up eating my fresh oysters because of Crimea? Who gave Putin the right to infringe onto my rights? I have worked hard to earn this money and I can spend it on what I want\" ....in another interview she said \"I don't want to live in \"Great Russia\", I don't mind at all if Russia is another peaceful and smaller Belgium\" . So yes, there are those, but they represent less than 5% of the Russian population.</p><p>I also travel to Moscow pretty often, and one Russian gentleman in his mid sixties once told me, in late 2014, when Crimea was STILL part of Ukraine \"we need to take Crimea, and we know it will get tough and we know we need to pay a price for Crimea, but everything in this life has a price. Crimea is a question of national security, of Russian survival, who needs the economy if we can't survive? We simply can't allow foreign military bases in Crimea, that would have been the end of Russia\"..... I said \"but Obama and Kerry are ready to promise that there won't be any military bases in Crimea?!\" .... he said \"Obama and Kerry will be gone in a few years, a new government comes in and says something else, as it has happened so often in our relations with America. Then what do we do, once Crimea is filled with NATO troops? Do we go into a WW3? A stitch in time, even if painful, saves nine\"</p><p>Was he wrong in his fears/forecasts? I am not sure.\u00a0</p><p>So Putin did what his people thought he should do - this is important to understand. Russians support what Putin did.... so stop pointing at Putin and saying \"he is the evil\".... think a bit. \u00a0He acted by using brute force, sure, I suspect because he panicked.\u00a0</p><p>The West has hit back with sanctions. Now the Russian economy needs to adjust and adapt. Russia has gone through enormous strains in the past, they should manage to come out of this one as well.

Saudi Arabia under the former crown prince, father of the current crown prince, pledged billions of dollars if the Syrian regime reformed and was more inclusive.\u00a0</p><p>What was the regime's response? It began a massive campaign of ethnic cleansing in the Homs area in the first half of 2012 leading to over half a million refugees. Iran gave the Syrian regime nearly 10 billion dollars directly or indirectly between 2011 and 2013 and Iraq's sectarian government began to directly fund Syria in 2013 and allowed 10s of thousands of militias (who became the \"Hashd militias\" in 2014 operating in Iraq in secure Sunni majority areas south of Baghdad well before ISIS appeared) to cross the border openly and fight under their own command with the regime.</p><p>As for terrorism, well punish the terrorists not the people. Everyone knows who did the crimes above and everyone who participated in them was punished and most importantly, that terrorism against civilians is rarely state sponsored. This is not applicable to Shia terrorism which is both state sponsored and aimed at Sunnis and has resulted in the current mess in Syria.</p><p>And Shias do suicide bombings and do kill westerners, they are smart enough to keep it under the radar, inside the ME and if there is a sunni fool to use they will use him.

The EU isn't better or worse for one reform, small or big, but for the capability to reform. Mr Cameron has endured a gruelling travelling schedule to meet 27 EU heads of government at least twice within a very short period of time. It is fair to presume that there is no other European leader who has quite the same understanding of how capable of reform the EU really is. Mr Cameron now sets out to convince the British public that the EU is capable of reform and worthy of being joined for that reason.</p><p>Actual reform, in fact, is another story. Full marks to Mr Cameron for apparently seeing that, too, and making it a part of his plan. The Prime Minister, most certainly, met with a lot of sympathy on his travels to European capitals.

Is it not the undisputable, quickest and easiest solution to aging, schrinking European populations ? In the same vain, we are told that the EU is the best way we can find to combine our forces for the benefit of our economies and, maybe, defences. Well, problem is all citizens do not share ''rational'' approaches to problem solving, especially concerning issues of this nature. In mass-immigration, the opponents do not necessarily see a solution to an aging population, but a danger of cultural and civilizational annihilation. For Europe, regardless of the economic benefits, many are repulsed by the loss of sovereignty and the growing influence of the unelected bureaucrats of Brussels. Instead of searching for ways of addressing these issues in an acceptable way, critics prefer to fall back on the old, name-calling method aimed at shaming their targets into submission.

The EP doesn't represent the ordinary working class European, at least, not yet, nor is it expected to. Ordinary working class Europeans are represented by their national parliaments who send their representatives to the European Commission whom the EP oversees. However, the EP has been doing an outstanding job in creating a level playing field for ordinary working class Europeans. Any Brit with a mind to can apply for any job anywhere in the EU. When he is hired he (or she) will enjoy the same work protection and worker's benefits as when working at home. Unfortunately, much of the current debate in the UK\u00a0takes aim at not letting this\u00a0advantage be reciprocal, but that should not detract from the achievement of the EP, nor from our hope that it will continue to create more and more equality throughout Europe. After all, this work can't be expected to be accomplished by any national parliament.</p><p>The EU is neither the cause of the next European conflict, nor is it the\u00a0answer\u00a0to one.

Honour (in their own definition), vengeance, pride were always widely present throughout Chechnya.... when Putin came to power, in 2000, Chechnya was already burning and filled with extremists, because of (a) corrupt Russian generals on one side (taking bribes from Chechens and taking and then giving back territories, month after month, just to make more money); and (b) Chechen mafia running casinos and drugs in Moscow (together with the Georgian mafia). So this is the environment in which Putin took over. So what could he have done otherwise? Chechnya invaded Inigushetia in \u00a01999 and Putin invaded Chechnya to kick them out, but by 1999 Chechens were already very well trained (mostly in Turkey) and very well armed and the Russian military was still VERY corrupt. So Putin had (a) oligarchs on one side (and these guys were essentially running the Russian \"Duma\" or parliament, at least half of elected officials were getting paid in cash by oligarchs to pass or block laws), and (b) corrupt military AND police on the other. This was Russia in 2000. So Putin decided to go after the oligarchs first - Gussinsky (who essentially controlled the media), Berezovsky (who had his fingers everywhere), Khodorkovsky (Oil) and many others.... and only in 2009/2010 he seriously went after the military, by firing hundreds of high-ranking officers, restructuring the army and so on....if he had touched the army in 2001, they would have killed him.... do not underestimate the power of the \"Deep State\" be it in the US or in Russia....</p>", "authorId": "4269096@ft.fyre.co", "id": "465723070", "authorName": "DavidT08"}, {"comment": "<p>Isn't that interesting that probably in the last couple of weeks FT doesn't bother to give any information about Ukraine, regardless of political turmoil there and the urgent visit of France and Germany foreign ministers ..\u00a0</p><p>\"<span>Kiev (AFP) - Germany and France on Tuesday urged Ukraine to root out corruption and quickly adopt a law on elections in the pro-Russian east that may help end the region's separatist war...</span>French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and his German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier arrived in Kiev in the midst of a bout of political turmoil that has seen ministers in the pro-EU government trade accusations of influence peddling and graft..\"</p><p>It is much better to keep FT readers attention away from the corrupt US backed Government in Kiev and focus on the \"extremely\" important Chechen leader personality!\u00a0</p>", "authorId": "3682747@ft.fyre.co", "id": "465542386", "authorName": "The Zeus"}, {"comment": "<p><a vocab=\"http://schema.org\" typeof=\"Person\" rel=\"nofollow\" resource=\"acct:7402558@ft.fyre.co\" data-lf-handle=\"\" data-lf-provider=\"livefyre\" property=\"url\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"fyre-mention fyre-mention-livefyre\">@<span property=\"name\">Thumbscrew</span></a>\u00a0Really?

I hope we can still sway sufficient numbers to seek diplomatic rather than armed responses. I am quite certain Russians feel precisely the same way. They are no more interested in world domination than you or I are. And just as terrified of another world war. The more we agitate for greater Nato armaments to be sent against Russia's perceived \"advantages\" on Europe's eastern borders, the more we indicate that Nato exists only because of a perceived Russian \"threat\", which really isn't there in my view.\u00a0</p><p>We need to keep making the point. Common sense alone should tell people that there is absolutely nothing whatsoever for Russia to gain from any military incursion in the Baltics. Putin's response to the Crimean plebiscite was not just \"acceptable\" to Russians, it was an imperative for 99% of the population. His domestic popularity would have been destroyed if he had failed to respond to the Crimean issue and, on the other hand, would be completely destroyed, at a stroke, if he revealed any imperialist intentions further west. This has to be so obvious to anyone who gives the matter a moments thought. We can't seem to get away from the Soviet era / cold war thinking, and yet Russians have.</p><p>Thanks again for the support.
